# Ashâ€™s PokÃ©mon Card Collection Assignment

The dahsboard is aimed to help Ash to explore and understand his PokÃ©mon card collection. 

## Tech
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** â†’ provides a fast, minimal, and type-safe setup. React for component-based UI development. TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability. Vite for fast builds, HMR (Hot Module Replacement), and an optimized ESM-based dev server.
- **Tailwind CSS** â†’ a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling faster and more maintainable. Enables responsive, reusable, and modern UI styling without writing custom CSS files. Treeshaking removes unused styles, reducing final bundle size.
- **Echarts** â†’ a data visualization library. Supports interactive charts with smooth animations. Optimized for large datasets, making it ideal for dashboard analytics. Works well with React to dynamically update charts based on data.
