# Ash’s Pokémon Card Collection Assignment

The dahsboard is aimed to help Ash to explore and understand his Pokémon card collection. 

## Tech
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** → provides a fast, minimal, and type-safe setup. React for component-based UI development. TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability. Vite for fast builds, HMR (Hot Module Replacement), and an optimized ESM-based dev server.
- **Tailwind CSS** → a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling faster and more maintainable. Enables responsive, reusable, and modern UI styling without writing custom CSS files. Treeshaking removes unused styles, reducing final bundle size.
- **Echarts** → a data visualization library. Supports interactive charts with smooth animations. Optimized for large datasets, making it ideal for dashboard analytics. Works well with React to dynamically update charts based on data.

## Approach and trade-offs

### Goals
A dashboard analyzing Ash's card collection can be useful for multiple purposes depending on what insights we extract from the data.
Possible use cases are:
1. Building different types of decks: know which card are available and how they fit into a deck strategy  (e.g. type balance, synergy).
2. Identifying strong cards for competitive play: if Ash wants to play in tournaments he needs to know which cards are powerful and legal.
3. Collection progress and set completion: if Ash is collecting full sets he needs to know which cards are missing.
4. Deciding which cards to sell or replace: some cards increase in value and others are not useful for current deck strategy.

The assignment does not explicitly state Ash’s goal, but it mentions that he participates in Pokémon card trials.
I assume this means he is actively using his collection for gameplay rather than just collecting for value.
Therefore, the primary use cases likely are 1 and 2.

### Navigating the dashboard
For this purpose the best type of dashboard is analytical, meaning it is important to see the big picture while also have the ability to explore detailed insights.

The dashboard includes following sections:  
📊 Summary → High-level statistics such as total number of cards, duplicates, sets count.  
📈 Charts → Visual breakdown of collection across different attributes.  
📅 Table → A detailed sortable, filterable view of cards for in-depth analysis.  
🔎 Detailed card view → Show full card information on hover or click on the table row.
⏳ Interactions → Apply filters to narrow down the dataset, enable cross-filtering where selections in table dynamically adjust other visualizations.

### Choice of charts

| Insights                                                                                          | Chart type                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Understand the collection’s composition (how many Pokémon, Trainer, and Energy cards)             | Bar chart with drilldown         |
| Check card distribution across different sets (which sets are most represented in the collection) | Treemap                          |
| Identify the strongest cards (HP, Damage, Abilities) vs support vs energy                         | Scatterplot (HP vs Attack power) |
| Legality for tournament play (rule formats) and card rarity                                       | Table with filtering             |


### Project structure
Currently, the project is a single-page application with a single route.
The project follows a modular structure, with components, services, and styles separated for better organization and maintainability.

```
/src
│── /assets          # Local JSON data, images
│── /components      # UI components (Charts, Tables, Cards)
│── /services        # API calls, external data fetching and processing
│── /styles          # Global styles (Tailwind)
│── App.tsx          # Main App Component
│── main.tsx         # Entry point
│── vite.config.ts   # Vite Configuration
```

1. Get local data (`ash_collection.json`), show loading indicator while data is being retrieved.
2. Fetch external data (Pokémon TCG API) o enrich local data (e.g., adding sets information). Merge external data with local data before rendering UI.
3. Compute derived values for charts and tables such as duplicates, set count, etc.
4. Update charts and tables based on user interactions (filters, selections).
5. State management is handled by React hooks `useState` and `useEffect`. No external state management (Redux, Zustand, etc.) is used as project complexity is low.
6. Filtered and processed data is computed in the parent component `Dashboard.tsx` and passed down as props to child components. Calculation logic is kept in separate utility functions to keep components clean.

### Trade-offs
- Chart readability: more advanced charts (e.g. treemaps, scatterplots) provide deeper insights but may be harder to interpret for casual users.
- Static vs. dynamic data: the dataset is enriched with set data from an external API during initial load. This increases startup time, and an alternative would be asynchronous loading, where charts update progressively. This would improve initial responsiveness but might introduce a loading state for charts.
- There is no single API endpoint that gives the total number of all existing Pokémon TCG cards. Since Pokémon TCG does not change frequently, I decided to hardcode `globalTotalCards` value based on the latest API data to save time on loading.

## Unimplemented features
### Product features
- Deck recommendations: suggest optimal decks based on available cards, considering playstyle preferences such as Aggro (fast attackers), Control (disruptive strategies), Spread Damage (multi-target attacks), and Tank/Stall (high-HP survival decks).
E.g. filter collection by archetype, recommend missing cards, etc.
- Card price tracking: show card values over time (requires external data source), suggest which duplicates are worth selling.
- Evolution tracking: identify which cards can evolve into or from others, helping with deck-building and collection progress.

### Technical features
- Card search: allow filtering by name, type, HP, rarity, and legality
- Responsive design: optimize for mobile and tablet screens to improve usability.
- Accessibility: improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- Error handling: display user-friendly messages for failed API calls.
